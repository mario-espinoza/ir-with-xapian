20150925193829AAxLBSm,License Suspension from Insurance Company in Flordia?,"Hi All! Quick question. I live in Florida with my boyfriend and his grandmother. They go through ""Foremost"" for their car insurance. Recently, their contract with them ended, and they were restarting one with them. We're all struggling really hard right now and they cant afford the initial payment right this second. So the Agent told his gma (supposedly), that if she does NOT pay it by the 30th, BOTH of their licenses will be SUSPENDED. She has a really hard time hearing people, and Im wondering if she got this mixed up somehow. Is this true? To my understanding, the State of Flordia and their insurance company are two totally different horses. I know that insurance companies can put a referall into the state to have your license suspeneded when you were in an accident with no insurance... but thats not the case! They just cant afford the 200$ within these 5 days! Anyone???",Cars & Transportation,Particulares

20130421122356AA9GcC2,Why am I still a virgin?,"I'm a 19-year-old male sophomore in college. I'm 5'8"" and 125 lbs. I'm decent looking, not ugly or anything. But I'm quite introverted with no real close friends. Unfortunately, I'm going to finish up my second year of college as a virgin. During this past sophomore year, I went to this nightclub about twelve times. I danced/grinded with a bunch of girls, but most of them would only dance with me for like 5-10 minutes and then leave. I got to kiss a few of them, but was never able to dance with any of them long enough to ask her to leave with me. In this past month or so, I did try messaging a few girls I knew on Facebook. I just asked some basic small talk questions about college stuff, and most of them responded and seemed friendly, but most stopped messaging me back once I asked them about what they're doing on the weekend (or something along those lines, the intention being to hang out and have sex). One thing I never managed to do this year was go to an alcohol-type frat party or something along those lines. Those places intimidate me. I'm a relatively small guy (5'8"" and 125 lbs) and I do NOT drink alcohol. Ever. So in the few cases I walked by one, I either never had the courage to walk in, or there was a line and I couldn't get in. Honestly, I do try to build muscle and all that stuff that everyone says. I try some weight lifting and protein foods and stuff, but all I usually do is tone my muscles and maybe gain five pounds. To just put on 30 pounds or something like that seems so far-fetched and nearly impossible from my personal experience. I'm not really good at making close friends, either. When I meet new people in class and stuff, I do try talking to people, including girls, but it never comes across to them as anything more than just small talk. I just don't understand how people make friends and hook up and stuff. I really don't. I'm a guy. If I see an attractive girl, I just want to have sex with her. Like, if she literally said ""let's have sex,"" I'd just be like ""okay."" But for girls, it's different. Girls will see an attractive guy, but for them it's more complicated. They have to jump through all these hoops before they can ever hook up. I don't get it. Why can't girls be more like guys and be more willing to hook up? I hate how people slut-shame girls and pressure them to not have sex. Girls shouldn't be discouraged from having sex. I wish girls could let loose more and not be so restrictive all the time. Also, I understand that some people want relationships and stuff, but I don't get why preferences have to be so different between guys and girls. Guys overwhelmingly want sex; girls less so. I wish there was more balance between the genders. In particular, I wish more girls were of the hook-up type. I'm sorry, it's close to the end of my sophomore year in college, and I'm just mad about never getting casual sex, so I'm venting. That's why I went into a long ramble. Congrats for reading this far. If anyone has any comments on things I said, or any tips on how to get laid, I would appreciate it. I'm not going to transform my life and make 100 new friends and gain 30 pounds of muscle and join a frat and get drunk or get a girlfriend. Ideally, I'm just looking for that conversation tip for befriending a girl in my class or at a club and being able to hook up with her. Thanks!",Local Businesses,Opiniones

Yesterday we arrived, went for a wander then enjoyed a meal in the bar. Today we went to a show and returned back to the bar for a meal. I ordered a burger and about half way through bit in to something rock solid. After taking it out my mouth it was small, white and hard with a sharp point on it. However, after swallowing something sharp, I realised it had actually chipped my tooth and cut my gum. The pain alone is agonising from the hole in my tooth and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom where I was violently sick due to the pain. The bar staff were very sympathetic and the duty manager came to our room with 2 complimentary bottles of water and a refund for the burger and has assured us that they will look in to things and the hotel manager will be in touch. The whole ordeal has left me very upset, vomiting and overall regretting ever coming! I know it's not the hotels fault as the responsibility lies with the supplier of the burgers but where do I stand now? As a customer paying ¶œ16 for a burger, I expect better. I want to take action against the person/company responsible for this negligence. What is my next step?",Dining Out,Opiniones

20150903083626AAAX4lg,Do evil dogs exist?,"Thankfully me and my partner managed to get rid of this dog, but he literally acted as if he was the devil incarnate. Here's some of the things he did. He'd refuse to go to toilet when he was let out at night, then the next morning we'd come into to find he'd pooed/weed on the carpet. He'd cross over to the side of the room you were sat on, fart, and then wander off. He'd hardly ever come when called, especially when out and he knew we couldn't catch him, a few times he actually run out into roads. He'd wind up my nan's dogs to the point they'd try to attack him, and then still keep trying to annoy them. One time my nan's dogs came round and laid on the sofa, and he wouldn't stop barking at her. He'd attack small animals with no remorse, and one time I took home an injured pigeon (I often take home hurt birds and then give them to the vets), and he literally tried to eat it. He seemed to have no sense of special awareness and would un straight into people, the week before we got rid of him he gave my gf a huge swollen ankle. Oh yeah and he used to steal our food, and constantly lick the floor if food had been dropped, I swear sometimes he actually used to get under our feet purposely so we'd trip over him and drop food. When he got caught in the kitchen one time, where he wasn't supposed to be, he suddenly made a run for the door, so obviously he wasn't dumb and knew what he was doing. Anyone else had a psychopathic malicious plotting devil dog? (Oh yeah and he used to stare constantly at us and other dogs, he especially stared at us while we were eating in a really sinister fashion) Julie D, I'm not a bad dog owner, I don't think you can teach a dog to respect you, like a person, they either respect you or they don't. Also I know for a fact not all dogs attack small animals, I have seen videos of dogs laying next to kittens, and how exactly do you train a dog out of malicious farting? Puppy, I'm not a bad owner, but we kept him the longest out of anyone who had him, the people who gave him to us clearly couldn't cope with him either. I can prove I'm not a bad dog owner because my nan's dogs always want to come up and see me, and get too excited when she's bringing them round to stay. You are just ignorant if you think a dog can't be psychopathic, or evil, because I'm pretty certain he was, he certainly didn't care about us, if he did he wouldn't have got on the table and started eating our food. Gemma, yes that proves it, psychopathy is a genetic trait in humans too! Our dog wasn't violent to us, but he didn't think about anyone but himself, whereas my nan's two lovely dogs would never do anything to upset us. They would certainly never dream of taking food from the table! We fed him, and told him bad when he done things we didn't want him to do. Yet he still tried to attack and eat wild animals. We tried to train him both with positive and negative reinforcement training, but he still didn't learn to respect us. He knew tricks and stuff just fine, but he didn't respect us, our things, or other dogs. I don't know really how any dog could not know to back off and leave a dog alone when it starts snarling at him, I actually think he got some sick pleasure out of winding my nan's dog up, and he wouldn't stop no matter how much she snarled, or how much we shouted. The most useful thing we taught him was ""go away"", but even then he'd push his luck and keep circling back round trying to get close to the table when we were eating, and he'd never listen to us outdoors because he knew we couldn't catch him. If he kept behaving badly he went for time out in his crate in the other room, but this didn't really stop his bad behaviour, he just became more sneaky with it.",Pets,Opiniones

Do you know that nearly 1% of US citizens are in prison. The highest percentage in the world. Someone has to pay for it. Also, military spending. A staggering one sixth of the total budget!

I ve been riding English and jumping since elementary school. I was surprisingly fearless and would fly over jumps any day with any horse. I wouldn t cry when I fell and actually laughed it off when it happened. Since I turned 18 I ve recently become incredibly fearful of any type of jumping on any horse. My trainer has been with me for a while but I can see that she s getting frustrated with me every time I cry uncontrollably after I either fall off or if the horse bucks a little. Don t get me wrong, I have a good stance and stay calm, but afterwards I just have panic attacks and I m so angry at myself. All I want to do is to be with horses and feel as free as they are. Everything that s happy makes me want to cry and I just want to be able to jump and ride and not be so scared. Both me and my trainer are so frustrated and I don t know what to do. Riding is everything to me. Do you have any advice or tips that could help me through this? Thank you so much.",Pets,Opiniones

20150926101923AAVNKjE,New skincare - what should I get?,"I've been using Cetaphil for awhile now because it's just a basic, gentle cleanser. It's not too bad really - I can't complain. I have been tempted to maybe try something from Aveeno though because I hear a lot of good things about it. I do want to try Aveeno's Clear Complexion pads... but I have some options. So here are the choices I'm considering - 1. Stick with using Cetaphil and then couple it with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Pads. 2. Use Aveeno Clear Complexion cleanser (foaming or cream) and the Clear Complexion pads. I also was wondering what moisturizers I should get - should I get CeraVe AM and CeraVe PM, or should I get two from Aveeno (SPF for day, regular for night)? One final point I have - I don't have severe acne... but I do have annoying little breakouts here and there (especially when my period is coming and stuff). They typically aren't cystic (just regular ""common"" pimples). I do have a few light pinkish post-marks on my cheeks from a breakout last month (it literally wouldn't go away no matter what I used for some reason -_-). So could I get anything from Aveeno that would help with fading the post-marks? I don't want ""anti-aging"" or stuff that makes me ""look younger"" because I'm only going to be 24. I also do NOT want anything that will cause an increase in breakouts. Thanks ahead of time! Good point Alexis. Aveeno does have an Ultra Calming wash. So maybe I should try that. And YES! Scrubs! I have bounced around but have not found out that I really am sold on enough to regularly buy it. I always find some kind of ""flaw"" unfortunately (some of the issues I've encountered are - too rough, not exfoliating enough, dries me out, breaks me out, etc.). Obviously I'm not going to get more than one. I will stick with one face wash, one kind of pad, one exfoliator and two moisturizers (one SPF for day, one regular for night). I would never use two washes or something. That's a bit insane.",Beauty & Style,Opiniones

She left me in the car and ran in, so I sat there. Not that long after, I started hearing voices outside. I turned around and saw two men standing right behind my car! One of the men was Black and huge and buff. He looked about in his late twenties, and let me note that I only got the quickest glimpse. The other man was much older, like a senior. And I think he was Asian. The Black man was looking directly into my car, and the Asian was looking into the car next to me. ""There's nothing here. I think I'll try the middle,"" the Black guy said. I turned back around in my seat, breathing hard. The two men scared the crap out of me and they disappeared real quick. My mom came back soon after and I told her. On the way out, I didn't see either of them still in the parking lot. Also, this happened a couple weeks ago. Do you think they were car thieves? And, what do I do if I see something like this again?

20150823030508AADPkH3,Will Carbon Dioxide melt ice?,"We have one contributor to this site, who makes that bold statement. https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index... Is this voodoo science or real science? Last Year: That statement was made directly. Also, that link is a Y!A link. The Y!A staff may be corrupt and in the tank for global warming, but I don't think Yahoo would last long if viruses were imbedded in their Q & As. If that happened, I am sure Marissa would chop a few heads off. But here is a direct copy and paste from that question by an answerer, Any carbon dioxide will melt ice. There is nothing magic about man made carbon dioxide, and you would know that if you actually learned some science, instead of quoting you hero, Goebbels. If anything, carbon dioxide outgassed from the oceans would be a stronger greenhouse gas than the carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. It is richer in oxygen-18, meaning that more carbon dioxide molecules have one atom of oxygen-16 and one atom of oxygen-18. Such a molecule is not perfectly symetrical and will absorb photons which cause symmetric stretching. (end of quote.)",Environment,Complejas

20150924045401AAyvkKg,What do you need for selling photo's on Ebay?,"So I recently heard of selling JPEG pics on eBay. (why someone would pay for some pics is beyond me) But apparently a lot of these JPEG photos are selling. I think this a great item to sell considering you can could sell infinite and you don't have to pay for shipping... and you dont have to walk to the post office. (im lazy lol) Anyways I wonder what is the requirements for selling the pictures. Do you have to provide Ebay some license or royalty thing to prove you own the picture. And also what if you took the pic yourself, not really any proof to provide there. And what if I took a pic of a celebrity or famous building do I own the rights to that then, or do I not own the rights sense its a pic of someone else or some thing. (I always wondered how paparazzi gets away with it) And couldn't you also just take snapshot of some old unknown movie and post that as your picture. Unlikely anyone coming after you then.
