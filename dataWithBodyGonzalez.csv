There is nothing magic about man made carbon dioxide, and you would know that if you actually learned some science, instead of quoting you hero, Goebbels. If anything, carbon dioxide outgassed from the oceans would be a stronger greenhouse gas than the carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. It is richer in oxygen-18, meaning that more carbon dioxide molecules have one atom of oxygen-16 and one atom of oxygen-18.

20150826052837AAaJO2P,What is it about AGW that you are skeptical of?,"This was asked of me in a comment to my answer yesterday. And I feel it is a very fair question. I'll answer first and invite skeptics to share their views on this. We know warmers are going to put words in our mouth so this should be interesting. My main scientific skepticism is climate sensitivity (ECS). Here are some specific problems I have related to that: - The value of ECS is given as a range of 1.5-4.5C. These values have not changed since the Charney Report in 1979. After billions of dollar in climate research and 36 years of work, the range has not been narrowed. - The common value for the median ECS is 3C and climate models use this value (or slightly above it). But many recent studies have come up with a median value much lower, closer to 2C. - If we assume a median ECS of 3C and given the amount of warming since the industrial era and given the amount of CO2 man has put into the atmosphere, especially over the past 30 years, for models to be correct, warming will have to accelerate to a very high rate. My secondary skepticism surrounds the predictions of the net effect of warming on ecosystems as well as the plausibility of actually reducing emissions in a way that has a net positive effect. For example, the EU ETS scheme has been an abysmal failure and has actually added emissions, the opposite of intended: http://sei-international.org/news-and-me... @FSM: ""I am skeptical that is a money grab.""

It was somewhat stubborn but luckily I blew the flame out when i took it out. I had the windows open after and the door open to let the room breathe a bit for about a half hour. In other rooms it doesnt smell like smoke anymore, but the microwave still smelled like smoke. I read that if you clean your microwave with some cloves it will get the smoke smell out, so I did that and now I can barely smell the smoke when I open the microwave. However, is the microwave still safe to use? When the pepper was on fire, it was just the tip and the flame was not this all encompassing thing. The microwave itself was not on fire, just the stem of the pepper. Will the microwave combust or something when I go to sleep or something? I know that sounds dumb, but I am kind of worried now. I hope it will be okay. Actually I can still smell some smoke in the microwave. lso there is nothing black in the microwave. The microwave is just as spotless as it was before.

The thought made me feel sick and I knew he had done wrong and given I was so ugly and covered up i didn't blame myself. I just dreamt that he escaped Prison. He went to my mothers house. I moved away several years ago but when he was not in prison that's where he knew we were. My family were there. I didn't actually see him but they had and the police were already there. Two police bully vans parked on the estate. I saw his car too. I couldn't stop crying I went and sat next to my older sister and burst out crying again I couldnt shut up. I said to her ""I told you he would come after me and you said I was being stupid"". I was crying at that time because my sister is always throwin away my thoughts saying I'm wrong. When I'm asleep I can feel if I'm crying and I was actually crying. Woke up and id been crying. I've always thought he would come after me when he got out I mean why wouldn't he, he told me not to tell, he couldn't go to prison ""again"". I think the sentence was 11 or 14 years I really can't remember but it's at least 5 and I'm almost 18.

20150903083626AAAX4lg,Do evil dogs exist?,"Thankfully me and my partner managed to get rid of this dog, but he literally acted as if he was the devil incarnate. Here's some of the things he did. He'd refuse to go to toilet when he was let out at night, then the next morning we'd come into to find he'd pooed/weed on the carpet. He'd cross over to the side of the room you were sat on, fart, and then wander off. He'd hardly ever come when called, especially when out and he knew we couldn't catch him, a few times he actually run out into roads. He'd wind up my nan's dogs to the point they'd try to attack him, and then still keep trying to annoy them. One time my nan's dogs came round and laid on the sofa, and he wouldn't stop barking at her. He'd attack small animals with no remorse, and one time I took home an injured pigeon (I often take home hurt birds and then give them to the vets), and he literally tried to eat it. He seemed to have no sense of special awareness and would un straight into people, the week before we got rid of him he gave my gf a huge swollen ankle. Oh yeah and he used to steal our food, and constantly lick the floor if food had been dropped, I swear sometimes he actually used to get under our feet purposely so we'd trip over him and drop food. When he got caught in the kitchen one time, where he wasn't supposed to be, he suddenly made a run for the door, so obviously he wasn't dumb and knew what he was doing. Anyone else had a psychopathic malicious plotting devil dog? (Oh yeah and he used to stare constantly at us and other dogs, he especially stared at us while we were eating in a really sinister fashion) Julie D, I'm not a bad dog owner, I don't think you can teach a dog to respect you, like a person, they either respect you or they don't. Also I know for a fact not all dogs attack small animals, I have seen videos of dogs laying next to kittens, and how exactly do you train a dog out of malicious farting? Puppy, I'm not a bad owner, but we kept him the longest out of anyone who had him, the people who gave him to us clearly couldn't cope with him either. I can prove I'm not a bad dog owner because my nan's dogs always want to come up and see me, and get too excited when she's bringing them round to stay. You are just ignorant if you think a dog can't be psychopathic, or evil, because I'm pretty certain he was, he certainly didn't care about us, if he did he wouldn't have got on the table and started eating our food. Gemma, yes that proves it, psychopathy is a genetic trait in humans too! Our dog wasn't violent to us, but he didn't think about anyone but himself, whereas my nan's two lovely dogs would never do anything to upset us. They would certainly never dream of taking food from the table! We fed him, and told him bad when he done things we didn't want him to do. Yet he still tried to attack and eat wild animals. We tried to train him both with positive and negative reinforcement training, but he still didn't learn to respect us. He knew tricks and stuff just fine, but he didn't respect us, our things, or other dogs. I don't know really how any dog could not know to back off and leave a dog alone when it starts snarling at him, I actually think he got some sick pleasure out of winding my nan's dog up, and he wouldn't stop no matter how much she snarled, or how much we shouted. The most useful thing we taught him was ""go away"", but even then he'd push his luck and keep circling back round trying to get close to the table when we were eating, and he'd never listen to us outdoors because he knew we couldn't catch him. If he kept behaving badly he went for time out in his crate in the other room, but this didn't really stop his bad behaviour, he just became more sneaky with it.",Pets,Complejas

Recently I've been drinking diet pop because it is one of the few beverages I can drink with zero carbs which means I don't have to give Insulin for it or worry about it hiking my sugars. However the fizz in the pop had started giving me lots of gas and had me going to the bathroom all night long to get rid of the gas (sorry for the details) So I quit drinking the pop and started with bottled water. But the bottled water to me has no flavor and I've never been a pure water drinker. And I can't drink tea yet because here in Israel it is still broiling blazing hot here still. So what is something I can drink with 0 carbs? Also I need a 0 carb alternative for my bedtime snack. Currently I eat 2 hard boiled eggs and slice them up and put Mayo on it. And don't worry I'm also on Lipitor and my LDL levels are in the 70's. But I think the Mayo has been putting too much weight on me and I've tried low fat mayo and it has no flavor whatsoever. So what's a zero carb alternative to eggs for a bedtime snack? I don't want to hike my blood sugar levels just before sleep. @ckngbbbls most flavored bottled waters have carbs that I've seen, and meat although having zero carbs have protein in it and the protein of the meat hikes my sugar like two hours after I've eaten it",Health,Otros

20150917101851AAhPcLF,Is it wiser to remain single and childless for life?,"Given the biased family court, if I were to get married and my wife were to divorce me, I would be robbed of everything, including my house, my car and my cash. Even worse, I would be robbed of my right to see my children. Worst of all, I would end up on the street due to having a huge part of my income garnished for alimony and child support, and I would end up in jail should I fail to pay. With more than half of all marriages ending in divorce, I believe many men have been destroyed by their wives and the family court. Thus, modern marriage, a contract that only exists to for women and the ruling elite to extract resources from men, is simply too dangerous for me, and as a sensible person, I will not enter such a contract. Starting a family without a woman is not sensible either. With rampant misandry, there is no reason to bring a boy into this world to suffer. There is no reason either to bring a girl into this world. First, women, especially feminists, are my enemies. I will not raise a child for the enemy. Second, I do not want to raise a child who will one day, through feminist brainwashing, become a man-hating monster who treats my fellow men with hostility and seeks to harm them.",Health,Opiniones

Now, for the first time in around 30 million years, the fragile ecosystem may also be home to some destructive predators: king crabs. They’re rising from the region’s deeper waters, and it’s thanks to climate change. Because of the ice, the shelf’s shallow waters have typically been a few degrees colder than deep waters off Antarctica, which has kept the crabs from invading. But over the past 50 years, Antarctica’s water temperatures have increased 1.5 degrees Celsius—more than twice the global average—leaving space for king crabs to move up the water column.""

20150929074113AAEsGwp,"Why do so many horse riders/trainers stay in the middle ages with their bits, spurs and training techniques?","Why do people still use bits, spurs etc? I hear some say that its kinder because beginner riders could not gently use a bit less bridle. I've seen the opposite and think it simply shows bad teaching. How are bridles with bits and spurs any different to lazy dog trainers using choke collars and' beating dogs into submission'? When I first learnt to ride I had no stirrups or bridle for a lot of the time so that I learned to use my body and voice instead or kicking and pulling, I see so many teaching children to pull on reins to stop and although they say give a light kick or nudge, many children really kick the ponies hard to move. Why is this? Why are we not evolving? Jeff, where is strawman and where is red herring? I admit the layout is pretty sloppy. I am seriously asking though why do people still use bits, spurs etc ... what is the need? I've ridden a few horses bitless and they were not any more difficult to ride than with a bit. Saying that a horse would not perform if it did not like it etc ... I do PARTLY agree, however having witnessed a horse that would never move and would move with spurs... I'm not a good rider, nor am I pretending to be. ... the horse was later found to have many leg problems that had gone undetected and laminitis, so after that went into retirement. Have you ever thought that a horses do things sometimes like people do, because not doing them would result in more drama, or that they may want to please their owner even if they are suffering? If a horse could speak it could say ' Well actually i'm not doing A because ....' Have you ever had a bit inside of your mouth and had it banging against your teeth? I have Jeff, you've not argued against anything I have said? I'm asking why I am wrong, you've basically just said ' because you are wrong' How is dog training methods not a good comparsion? I can't think of a better one, what would have been a better one? or would it be better if nobody even tried? What was wrong with the laminitis story and that I have had a bit in my mouth? its pretty normal when having a bridle fitted in NH circles. Why is my anon status causing so much paranoia. I'm not an animal rights activist. I've worked with horses, had horses, rode horses for over 20 years. I've not seen one person so far do anything other than pat themselves on the back and reaffirm why they use things. 'My horse wouldn't understand how to communicate otherwise...' 'precision' .. 'I couldn't halfpass or side pass' maybe you couldn't but a rider who had learned to not use those tools could do, which is my point... ..people are not willing to change things to make it better for their horse, its whatever is easier for them. If a horse is lazy and doesn't want to be ridden, why make it do things it doesn't want to do, I never understood that, I only choose to ride horses that are eager to please and want to be ridden, find out what they like. And I don't exactly choose easy horses. A couple of them would not let anyone else ride them without throwing them off.

20151016212439AA1OLKL,Do I have extreme views on humanity and reality?,"- I think that people are naturally selfish and no one really cares about anyone else. Anytime people try to help someone is done out of obligation or because they want something out of it, relationships are basically mutually beneficial buisness deals and all of your friends and family will have no problem stealing/betraying/killing you if you get in the way. - Love does not exist. It is merely a glorified form of sexual desire and ""romance"" is purely based on looks. - Everybody is naturally racially biased. Everybody values their own race over others. Whenever someone sees someone of the same race (white, black etc) they unconcioussly see them as a potential ally, while when they see people of a different race, they see them as a potential enemy. - People are naturally a certain way. Being taught to be different (i.e. social conditioning) is the same as putting on a costume and pretending to be someone else. If you do not act on your natural desires and only on the behaivors you were taught, you are essentially being an actor in a play. - Everybody lies and you have no reason or proof to trust anyone. - Even if you could trust anyone and they really cared about you, they'll eventually leave your life one way or another. When someone is gone out of your life, all your left with is bitter memories or nostalgia, making you better off having never met the person at all. - People like violence.

I pretty much mastered the cash register within the first month and I've always showed up on time, am great with the customers/cleaning, etc. However I've made a lot of (stupid) mistakes in this time, from not knowing which mop to use to giving back the wrong change on a few occasions (not that I don't know how to count, mind you, just an error), and of course having to ask my manager to void orders, forgetting to give people their receipts/cups, spilling ice, also stuttering on my words or freezing up in front of people few times. One of my shift managers had problems with me almost every time we worked together, because I wasn't doing one of my chores efficiently enough which I admit to and do better now, and once she wanted me to take an order and didn't have my headset on so I couldn't. She's also sent me home early on few occasions. Everyone else has been nice to and makes it seem like it's no big deal at all but idk. The few other people who were hired at the same time as I was seem to be doing more (already taking orders on drive thru) and today I was taking drive thru orders for the first time and ****** up many times cause we were busy and I'm bad under pressure. The main manager seems to like me and has never had a problem with me, at least never showed it so I don't know what to think. I feel like others are judging me. by mastering the register within a month, i meant learning where all of the items are (they are abbreviated and have several sub categories), different coupon look ups, how to activate gift cards, how to ring up special orders/secret menu items, etc., not just do the money",Business & Finance,Opiniones
