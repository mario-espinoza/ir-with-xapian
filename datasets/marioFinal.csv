She said that she really wanted to go on a certain day and i said that i can get tickets and that we could go together.  That's when things went wrong.  She took that and turned it around on me, saying that i shouldn't go around offering stuff like that to people, and if i do I'll be used and thrown away.  This really took me aback, so i just tried to just recover ground. i cant remember what i said, but i ended up walking her to her dorm and leaving.  In the end she didn't seem to realize that i asked her out and i really don't know where i went wrong.

            Would you please cc this poem about a tree?
        ",UK," High on a hill, where the wind whistles low, 
and whispers sweet secrets to flowers below; 
Where neon green grasses ripple like waves, 
bowing and swaying at the foot of dark caves. 
 
A tremendous tree grows here and towers, 
over the land bespeckled with flowers; 
It branches reach for diamond white skies, 
watching the world with emerald eyes. 
 
Beneath this grand tree, writers in silence, 
write with a quiet, desperate, defiance; 
Onward they write, on sepia pages, 
For centuries now, throughout all the ages. 
 
They write of the songs, that yet are unsung, 
They write of the tales, for the old and the young; 
They write of their thoughts, in mystical verse, 
They write prose concisely, lucid and terse. 
 
Each writer sits quiet, then pauses to think, 
of words that dance blithely in invisible ink; 
Tho' quiet, each writer is never forlorn, 
because when you're writing, you can't be alone! 
 
You can be all you want, you get to choose, 
No one dare berate, insult and abuse! 
Each writer is smiling, laughing within, 
for each story that ends, one more must begin! 
 
It is here that you can be safe, strong and free, 
for this tree, gentle friend, is God's poetry...",1,1,0

            Does the African Humid Period hold the key as to why we have NATURAL, abrupt Climate Shifts that affect the entire World?
        ",EN," "" ... The African Humid Period occurred between 14,800 and 5,500 years ago, and was the last occurrence of a ""green Sahara"". Conditions in the Sahara during the African Humid Period were dominated by a strong North African Monsoon, resulting in larger annual rainfall totals compared to today’s conditions. With the increased rainfall, the vegetation patterns North Africa were nothing like what we see today. The majority of the Sahara region for instance was characterized by expansive grasslands, also known steppe. Meanwhile, the Sahel region south of the Sahara was mostly savanna. Today the Sahara region is mostly desert and the Sahel is characterized by steppe conditions. The African Humid Period was also characterized by a network of vast waterways in the Sahara, consisting of large lakes, rivers, and deltas. The four largest lakes were Lake Megachad, Lake Megafezzan, Ahnet-Mouydir Megalake, and Chotts Megalake. Large rivers in the region included the Senegal River, Nile River, Sahabi River, and Kufra River. These river and lake systems provided corridors that allowed many animal species, including humans, to expand their range across the Sahara. ... "" 
 
Here's what recently happened during the Little Ice Age also : 
 
"" ... cooling events during the Little Ice Age Period are detected in sediments accumulating off Africa, but the cooling events appear to be larger, ranging between 3–8 °C. ... ""
 Here's my link for those who demand one for verifying : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Afri... 
 
Additionally from my link :  
 
"" ... Geologic evidence from the beginning and end of the African Humid Period suggests that both the onset and termination of the African Humid Period were abrupt. In fact both events likely occurred on a timescale of decades to centuries. ... ""
 There have been 5 ""warming periods"" since the last REAL Ice Age 12,000 years ago. The African Humid Period accounts for 2 of these warm periods. These 2 warming periods were very abrupt just as the current warming period has been.  We are currently in the 5th warming period. This warming period equals the previous 4.

There is no way that I can have a child at this time.  
 
I was thinking about going to my local pharmacy and collecting a morning after pill, is this a good idea? And can I get it for free? 
 
Also, my period is due in 3 days and I am really hoping it comes, however my best friend told me that if I keep worrying about being pregnant, it could delay my pregnancy. 
 
I am completely terrified, I don't know if I could be pregnant and I don't know what to do! There is no way I can tell my mum about this either.. 
 
Please help me..",1,1,0

            Long distance girlfriend wants me to move to England?

We want to take the next step and move in together but she lives in England while I live in Canada. I am already and British Citizen and have lived there for a year a couple years ago, I have also busted England every summer my entire life because I have family there. I really do love it there, the personalities and the humour. No matter how much I may like to visit, I can't imagine living there especially if we ever have children. The houses are small and expensive, I would be paid far less for my job and the areas we could afford wouldn't be as safe. I told we that we could wait and she could eventually move here. I said that we could look into me sponsoring her, but she's not having any of it. She loves England and that's that. We would have a better life in Canada  , our combined salary could potentially be around 200k Canadian while in England we would make around 50k British. That's not bad and we could find a decent place according to British standards but coming from Canada it's a giant downgrade. Making 200k where I live would get us a better home in a safer neighbourhood and a little extra money for entertainment and holidays. I've tried so hard to convince her but she's just too in love with England. I have no idea what to do in this situation. How do I change her mind? Can you change mine?

An example of this would be Christmas when department store nation wide say happy holidays in lieu marry Christmas. I'm an athiest however I'm not going to be offended by somebody telling me marry Christmas or get mad at a manger seen or a Christmas tree inside a store I also have Jewish friends who feel the same way as I do. I realize this is turning into a rant but I just got to ask how much better off do you think we would be if everybody just through up thier middle finger and said I'm going to think, say, and do what I want and if the political correct police don't like it they can all just go **** them selves?",0,1,0

            Emiratis: Do you agree that your government's opposition to Islamism stems from their hatred of Islam?
        ",EN," From the Khaleej Times: 
 
Dr Gargash said: ""In particular, we must develop better legal mechanisms to not only combat the violent actions of terrorists, but also their extremist ideologies, which aim to undermine state structures and institutions and SECULAR visions of progress and modernity."" 
 
He supports SECULARISM, MEANING HE OPPOSES RULING ACCORDING TO GOD'S LAW. THIS IS APOSTASY! How do you feel about your government ministers being apostates? 
 
http://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/government/together-we-will-rebuild-region-uae 
 
The UAE government seems to be highly opposed to Islam. Do you think that when the government speaks out against ""Islamism"", it's really condemning Islam?
 The people here don't understand what I'm saying. 
 
I'm not talking about terrorist organizations. 
 
The UAE government and ministers have made it clear in the past that ""religion should be separated from politics"" and that secularism should be implemented in the Middle East. You can find the sources for these quite clear on the internet.  
 
Rather then diverging on about another subject (terrorist organizations), how about the people here answer the question and stay on topic.",0,1,0

            Why does EVERYONE think One Direction broke up?
        ",EN," I'm a big One Direction fan and I know what's going on. They said they're not splitting up at least 50 times, both at concerts and on Twitter. They said they love what they're doing and are coming back after their break. They're taking a short break starting in MARCH next year. It hasn't even started. They just won't have a tour or new album next year. They even said part of the reason they're taking a break is to work on music and Louis and Liam are going to work together on making better music. They even said there's going to be a 2017 tour. So many bands and celebrities take breaks as long as 3 years and no one thinks they're splitting up. 1D did tours 4 years and a row and 5 albums in a row, they said they barely ever see their family. The break has nothing to do with them splitting up. Just recently, they said the four of them love what they're doing and want to continue. Everywhere I go, everyone says they already split up. Why? I don't get it?
Obviously to confirm, they have NOT split up and they're not planning on it. Only the proper fans know that.
Their new album hasn't even come out yet!! They have like 10 shows to do for promo! How would they be doing that if they're not together?
Someone wrote an article about them not getting along and they literally tweeted saying that it's a dumb rumor. I think if the boys had tension and wanted to break up it would be much more obvious.",0,1,0

I also told her not to handle them, only to let them out to run around together and maybe hold or pet them occasionally, just in case they might become attached to her :/ 
I also am going to sleep with a small blanket a few nights before I go and then put it in their cage so they have my scent. Also, skyping them so they can hear my voice. 
They re like my children okay! 
So what do you think? Do you think they ll forget me or not? I know they re very smart, I m just worried. Not to mention my oldest one has very bad separation anxiety even if I just leave the room.",0,1,0

I always have my eyes closed when this happens and I can't seem to open them, I can't really do anything. I also hear someone in my head yelling and see vivid pictures (like a dream) there's also a loud banging inside my head. I feel very scared.

It happens a few times the same  night when I try to go back to sleep
Definitely not a luciid dream, the actual definition of lucid dreaming is when you can control your dreams.
